# AI Usage Disclosure

## What I used AI for
 Overall website structure planning
 JavaScript animations (GSAP, ScrollTrigger)
 Accessibility best practices (ARIA, keyboard navigation)
 CSS optimization
 Performance optimizations and refactoring

## What I edited manually
- Final HTML structure and semantic layout
- All content text, section ordering, and UI decisions
- Carousel logic tuning and bug fixing
- Responsive breakpoints and spacing
- Accessibility fine-tuning based on Lighthouse feedback

## Generated code kept and why
- GSAP animation logic: used for smooth, performant animations
- Carousel helper functions: clean and reusable
